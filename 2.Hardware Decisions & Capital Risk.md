Every hardware choice is a trade,off between performance, reliability, and upfront cost. Over-investing can strain cash flow; under-investing risks frequent failures. I prioritize durable, field-tested devices that minimize maintenance and downtime. Backup power, weatherproofing, and network redundancy aren’t optional,they’re essential. I treat each deployment like a small business: manage capital carefully, anticipate failures, and optimize for long,term ROI. Risk isn’t eliminated, but it’s predictable and manageable with thoughtful hardware selection and planning.
