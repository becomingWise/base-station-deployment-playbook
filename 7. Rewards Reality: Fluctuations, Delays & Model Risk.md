Rewards aren’t guaranteed, they fluctuate with network performance, carrier acceptance, and model assumptions. Short-term dips are normal; long-term trends matter most. I track payouts carefully, avoid chasing spikes, and adjust deployments based on consistent underperformance. Delays from approvals, syncing, or reporting are inevitable, so I plan cash flow conservatively. Understanding reward mechanics, modeling risk, and avoiding emotional reactions keeps the operation stable. Profit comes from steady, resilient networks, not chasing every temporary gain.
