Hosts can make or break a deployment. Reliable, communicative partners reduce downtime and frustration, while unresponsive or transient hosts create hidden risk. I prioritize clear agreements, redundancy where possible, and ongoing engagement. Even technically perfect setups fail if human factors aren’t managed. Trust, documentation, and regular check-ins help identify early warning signs of host-related issues. Managing human risk is as critical as hardware or location, often more so, because unpredictable behavior can quietly undermine months of work.
