# base-station-deployment-playbook
General Overview

This guide comes from real deployments, real mistakes, and real time spent trying to make GEODNET and Helium Mobile actually work in the field. It’s not based on theory or screenshots of dashboards-it’s based on mounting hardware, losing sites, troubleshooting bad internet, dealing with power issues, waiting on carrier approvals, watching rewards fluctuate, and slowly learning what matters and what doesn’t.

From the outside, DePIN looks clean and passive. In practice, it’s messy. Locations fall through. Hosts disappear. Rewards change. Devices go offline at the worst times. Some installs that looked perfect on paper quietly underperform, while others you almost skipped end up carrying your whole network.

Most of what actually determines outcomes never shows up on a whitepaper.

I wrote this guide to document what I wish I had known earlier:

The hidden friction in real deployments

The difference between “good” locations and actually profitable ones

What breaks most often and why

How to think about scaling without blowing up your cash flow

And how to tell early when a setup is quietly failing

This isn’t a promise of easy passive income. DePIN, at least in my experience, is really an operations and logistics problem wrapped in crypto rewards. The people who do well long-term aren’t necessarily the most technical, they’re the ones who stay consistent, manage risk, and design their setups to survive bad months.

My intention with this guide is simple:

Share what actually happened, not what should have happened

Save you time, money, and frustration

And give you a clearer way to decide if this path really fits you

If you’re just exploring DePIN, this should help you enter with your eyes open. If you’re already running hardware, I hope some of these lessons help tighten your operation and reduce unnecessary stress.
