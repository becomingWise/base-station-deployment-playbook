Deployment success depends on doing the basics right. Poor mounting, improper grounding, or exposure to the elements creates silent failures. I focus on sturdy hardware placement, secure mounting, and easy access for maintenance. Solar panels, antennas, and backup power must be optimized for local conditions. Every inch of cabling and every junction matters, small oversights compound into downtime. Physical reality always wins over theory, so I treat each installation as an engineering problem, testing, adjusting, and documenting to ensure reliability.
