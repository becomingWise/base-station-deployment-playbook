Most setups don’t die dramatically, they rot quietly. Power gets unplugged, firmware stalls, LTE plans expire, or a host “forgets” the deal. Small issues compound until rewards flatline and no one notices. Over-optimizing hardware while ignoring monitoring is another killer. The fastest way to fail is scaling before your first few nodes survive months without intervention. DePIN punishes neglect more than bad math.
