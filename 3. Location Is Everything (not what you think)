How I Actually Qualify Helium Mobile vs GEODNET

Early on, I tried to judge Helium Mobile and GEODNET locations with the same mental checklist. That was a mistake. They look similar from far away-antennas, cables, roofs-but they reward completely different things. Over time, I ended up with two very different ways of “seeing” a location depending on which network I’m deploying for.

One thing they do share though: both absolutely require steady, reliable internet. Past that, everything diverges.

How I Think About Helium Mobile (Indoor)

For Helium Mobile indoor hotspots, I eventually stopped overcomplicating it. The strongest signal is still the simplest:

Are there lots of people here, and are they actively on their phones?

That’s the core of it.

I look for:

Consistent foot traffic

People who actually hang around, not just pass through

Environments where phones are naturally in people’s hands
(gyms, cafés, waiting rooms, lounges, barbershops, small businesses with dwell time)

Because the hardware is relatively cheap, I don’t need every location to be perfect. I’m willing to deploy into:

Sub-optimal business locations

Places that might start slow

Sites that need months before they really show anything

Helium, for me, is a long-term demand game, not a precision install game. Some of my weakest-looking sites early on improved later as:

Carrier routing changed

More subscribers appeared

Local behavior shifted

On the internet side, Helium is demanding:

I generally assume you need real broadband

Roughly 100 Mbps down / 10 Mbps up for a site to be “comfortable”

Anything flaky or throttled shows up fast in performance

So my real Helium qualification test is very human:

Do people actually stay here?

Do they scroll, stream, and use data?

Does this place feel alive across different days and times?

Is the internet truly stable, not just “advertised fast”?

If yes, I’m willing to try it-even if the location looks imperfect on paper.

How I Think About GEODNET (RTK / Space Weather)

GEODNET ignores human behavior almost completely. People don’t matter. Geometry and uptime do.

This is my simple mental model for checking sky quality:

I take the height of the install point.

I draw an imaginary horizontal plane at that height.

From that horizon line, I allow about 10 degrees of vertical clearance.

Beyond that, everything should be clean sky.

If trees, buildings, or terrain push heavily into that 10-degree window, I already know the station will never be ideal. But once a site clears that basic threshold, most “good enough” locations behave very similarly in earnings.

Yes-exceptional GEODNET stations do exist, and some earn more. But I no longer chase those outliers. In practice, chasing perfection usually increases:

Install complexity

Host dependence

Permission fragility

Risk of total loss if the site disappears

What actually dominates GEODNET outcomes long-term is:

Can I secure the NFT?

Can I keep the station online for years?

Can uptime stay high without constant intervention?

A boring rooftop with decent sky, stable power, and low human risk will usually outperform a technically beautiful site that vanishes in six months. Here, uptime and control compound harder than peak performance.

On internet requirements, GEODNET is incredibly light:

It may only need ~10 Mbps up or less

Total data usage can be as low as ~3 GB for an entire month

Reliability matters far more than speed

This makes GEODNET viable in places where Helium would never work-and also means you should never risk a GEODNET station to chase premium internet the way you might for Helium.
