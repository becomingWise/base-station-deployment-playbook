DePIN is not passive income. It’s ops, logistics, and delayed feedback disguised as crypto. Hardware breaks. Hosts disappear. Rewards fluctuate or stall for reasons you won’t see on a dashboard. If you need fast validation or clean cause-and-effect, this will frustrate you. The upside exists, but only if you treat this like a long-term infrastructure bet, not a yield farm. Most failures aren’t technical—they’re patience, cash flow, and expectations collapsing before the network ever does.
